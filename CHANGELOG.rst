Changelog
---------

3.0.0rc9 (unreleased)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``DateTime`` does not affect timezone information
  on serialization and deserialization (:issue:`1234`, :pr:`1287`).
- Add ``NaiveDateTime`` and ``AwareDateTime`` to enforce timezone awareness
  (:issue:`1234`, :pr:`1287`).
- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``List`` does not wrap single values in a list on
  serialization (:pr:`1307`).
- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``Schema.handle_error`` receives ``many`` and ``partial`` as keyword arguments (:pr:`1321`).
- Use `raise from` more uniformly to improve stack traces (:pr:`1313`).
- Rename ``Nested.__schema`` to ``Nested._schema`` to prevent name mangling (:issue:`1289`).
- Performance improvements (:pr:`1309`).

Deprecations/Removals:

- ``LocalDateTime`` is removed (:issue:`1234`).
- ``marshmallow.utils.utc`` is removed. Use ``datetime.timezone.utc`` instead.

Bug fixes:

- Fix behavior of `List(Nested("self"))` (`#779 (comment) <https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues/779#issuecomment-396354987>`_).

  for parsing  ISO 8601 datetimes, dates and times. Timezone info is now
  correctly deserialized whether or not dateutil is installed. (:pr:`1265`)
- Improve error messages for ``validate.Range``.
- Use ``raise from exc`` for better stack traces (:pr:`1254`). Thanks
  :user:`fuhrysteve`.
- python-dateutil is no longer used. This resolves the inconsistent behavior

+++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``many`` is passed as a keyword argument to methods decorated with
  ``pre_load``, ``post_load``, ``pre_dump``, ``post_dump``,
  and ``validates_schema``. ``partial`` is passed as a keyword argument to
  methods decorated with ``pre_load``, ``post_load`` and ``validates_schema``.
  ``**kwargs`` should be added to all decorated methods.

+++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- Add ``fields.Tuple`` (:issue:`1103`) Thanks :user:`zblz` for the PR.

  are no longer passed to the final ``ValidationError`` raised upon
  validation completion (:issue:`996`).

3.0.0rc1 (2018-11-29)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: Rework ``ValidationError`` API.
  It now expects a single field name, and error structures are merged
  in the final ``ValidationError`` raised when validation completes.
  This allows schema-level validators to raise errors for individual
  fields (:issue:`441`). Thanks :user:`maximkulkin` for
  writing the original ``merge_errors`` implementation in :pr:`442` and thanks
  :user:`lafrech` for completing the implementation in :pr:`1026`.

+++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- Support partial loading of nested fields (:pr:`438`). Thanks

- Fix ``Date`` deserialization when using custom format (:issue:`1001`). Thanks
  :user:`Ondkloss` for reporting.

Deprecations/Removals:

- ``prefix`` parameter or ``Schema`` class is removed (:issue:`991`). The same
  can be achieved using a ``@post_dump`` method.


3.0.0b17 (2018-10-13)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- Add ``format`` option to ``Date`` field (:pr:`869`).
- *Backwards-incompatible*: Rename ``DateTime``'s ``dateformat`` Meta option
  to ``datetimeformat``. ``dateformat`` now applies to ``Date`` (:pr:`869`).
  Thanks :user:`knagra` for implementing these changes.
- Enforce ISO 8601 when deserializing date and time (:issue:`899`).
  Thanks :user:`dushr` for the report and the work on the PR.

- Fix inconsistencies in field inference by refactoring the inference feature
  into a dedicated field (:issue:`809`). Thanks :user:`taion` for the PR.
- When ``unknown`` is not passed to ``Nested``, default to nested ``Schema``
  ``unknown`` meta option rather than ``RAISE`` (:pr:`963`).
  Thanks :user:`vgavro` for the PR.
- Fix loading behavior of ``fields.Pluck`` (:pr:`990`).
- Includes bug fix from 2.16.0.

3.0.0b16 (2018-09-20)
+++++++++++++++++++++

- Fix ``root`` attribute for nested container fields
  on inheriting schemas (:issue:`956`). Thanks :user:`bmcbu`
  for reporting.

3.0.0b15 (2018-09-18)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Bug fixes:

- Raise ``ValidationError`` instead of ``TypeError`` when non-iterable types are
  validated with ``many=True`` (:issue:`851`).
- ``many=True`` no longer iterates over ``str`` and ``collections.abc.Mapping`` objects and instead
  raises a ``ValidationError`` with ``{'_schema': ['Invalid input type.']}`` (:issue:`930`).
- Return ``[]`` as ``ValidationError.valid_data`` instead of ``{}`` when
  ``many=True`` (:issue:`907`).

Thanks :user:`tuukkamustonen` for implementing these changes.

3.0.0b14 (2018-09-15)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- Add ``fields.Pluck`` for serializing a single field from a nested object
  (:issue:`800`). Thanks :user:`timc13` for the feedback and :user:`deckar01`
  for the implementation.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: Passing a string argument as ``only`` to
  ``fields.Nested`` is no longer supported. Use ``fields.Pluck`` instead
  (:issue:`800`).
- Raise a `StringNotCollectionError` if ``only`` or ``exclude`` is
  passed as a string to ``fields.Nested`` (:pr:`931`).
- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``Float`` takes an ``allow_nan`` parameter to
  explicitly allow serializing and deserializing special values (``nan``,
  ``inf`` and ``-inf``). ``allow_nan`` defaults to ``False``.

Other changes:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``Nested`` field now defaults to ``unknown=RAISE``
  instead of ``EXCLUDE``. This harmonizes behavior with ``Schema`` that
  already defaults to ``RAISE`` (:issue:`908`). Thanks :user:`tuukkamustonen`.
- Tested against Python 3.7.

3.0.0b13 (2018-08-04)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Bug fixes:

- Errors reported by a schema-level validator for a field in a ``Nested`` field
  are stored under corresponding field name, not ``_schema`` key (:pr:`862`).
- Includes bug fix from 2.15.4.

Other changes:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: The ``unknown`` option now defaults to ``RAISE``
  (`#524 (comment) <https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues/524#issuecomment-397165731>`_,
  :issue:`851`).
- *Backwards-incompatible*: When a schema error is raised with a ``dict`` as
  payload, the ``dict`` overwrites any existing error list. Before this change,
  it would be appended to the list.
- Raise a `StringNotCollectionError` if ``only`` or ``exclude`` is
  passed as a string (:issue:`316`). Thanks :user:`paulocheque` for
  reporting.

3.0.0b12 (2018-07-04)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- The behavior to apply when encountering unknown fields while deserializing
  can be controlled with the ``unknown`` option (:issue:`524`,
  :issue:`747`, :issue:`127`).
  It makes it possible to either "include", "exclude", or "raise".
  Thanks :user:`tuukkamustonen` for the suggestion and thanks
  :user:`ramnes` for the PR.

.. warning::

  The default for ``unknown`` will be changed to ``RAISE`` in the
  next release.

Other changes:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: Pre/Post-processors MUST return modified data.
  Returning ``None`` does not imply data were mutated (:issue:`347`). Thanks
  :user:`tdevelioglu` for reporting.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``only`` and ``exclude`` are bound by
  declared and additional fields. A ``ValueError`` is raised if invalid
  fields are passed (:issue:`636`). Thanks :user:`jan-23` for reporting.
  Thanks :user:`ikilledthecat` and :user:`deckar01` for the PRs.
- Format code using pre-commit (:pr:`855`).

  :user:`DenerKup` for reporting and thanks :user:`surik00` for the PR.
- ``fields.UUID`` deserializes ``bytes`` strings using ``UUID(bytes=b'...')`` (:pr:`625`).
  Thanks :user:`JeffBerger` for the suggestion and the PR.

Bug fixes:

- Fields nested within ``Dict`` correctly inherit context from their
  parent schema (:issue:`820`). Thanks :user:`RosanneZe` for reporting
  and :user:`deckar01` for the PR.
- Includes bug fix from 2.15.3.

3.0.0b8 (2018-03-24)
++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: Add ``data_key`` parameter to fields for
  specifying the key in the input and output data dict. This
  parameter replaces both ``load_from`` and ``dump_to`` (:issue:`717`).
  Thanks :user:`lafrech`.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: When `pass_original=True` is passed to one
  of the decorators and a collection is being (de)serialized, the
  `original_data` argument will be a single object unless
  `pass_many=True` is also passed to the decorator (:issue:`315`,
  :issue:`743`). Thanks :user:`stj` for the PR.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: Don't recursively check nested required
  fields when the Nested field's key is missing (:issue:`319`). This
  reverts :pr:`235`. Thanks :user:`chekunkov` reporting and thanks
  :user:`lafrech` for the PR.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: Change error message collection for `Dict` field (:issue:`730`). Note:
  this is backwards-incompatible with previous 3.0.0bX versions.
  Thanks :user:`shabble` for the report and thanks :user:`lafrech` for the PR.

3.0.0b7 (2018-02-03)
++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: Schemas are always strict (:issue:`377`).
  The ``strict`` parameter is removed.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: `Schema().load` and `Schema().dump` return ``data`` instead of a
  ``(data, errors)`` tuple (:issue:`598`).
- *Backwards-incomaptible*: `Schema().load(None)` raises a
  `ValidationError` (:issue:`511`).

See :ref:`upgrading_3_0` for a guide on updating your code.

Thanks :user:`lafrech` for implementing these changes.
Special thanks to :user:`MichalKononenko`, :user:`douglas-treadwell`, and
:user:`maximkulkin` for the discussions on these changes.

  on serialization (:issue:`608`). This makes them more consistent with the other
  fields and improves serialization performance. Thanks again :user:`lafrech`.

3.0.0b5 (2017-12-30)
++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

  ``Dict`` field's constructor. This mirrors the ``List``
  field's ability to validate its items (:issue:`483`). Thanks :user:`deckar01`.

3.0.0b2 (2017-03-19)
++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- Add ``truthy`` and ``falsy`` params to ``fields.Boolean`` (:issue:`580`). Thanks :user:`zwack` for the PR. Note: This is potentially a breaking change if your code passes the `default` parameter positionally. Pass `default` as a keyword argument instead, e.g. ``fields.Boolean(default=True)``.

Other changes:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``validate.ContainsOnly`` allows empty and duplicate values (:issue:`516`, :issue:`603`). Thanks :user:`maximkulkin` for the suggestion and thanks :user:`lafrech` for the PR.

++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- ``dump_only`` and ``load_only`` for ``Function`` and ``Method`` are set based on ``serialize`` and ``deserialize`` arguments (:issue:`328`).

Other changes:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``fields.Method`` and ``fields.Function`` no longer swallow ``AttributeErrors`` (:issue:`395`). Thanks :user:`bereal` for the suggestion.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``validators.Length`` is no longer a subclass of ``validators.Range`` (:issue:`458`). Thanks :user:`deckar01` for the catch and patch.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: ``utils.get_func_args`` no longer returns bound arguments. This is consistent with the behavior of ``inspect.signature``. This change prevents a DeprecationWarning on Python 3.5 (:issue:`415`, :issue:`479`). Thanks :user:`deckar01` for the PR.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: Change the signature of ``utils.get_value`` and ``Schema.get_attribute`` for consistency with Python builtins (e.g. ``getattr``) (:issue:`341`). Thanks :user:`stas` for reporting and thanks :user:`deckar01` for the PR.

++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- Add useful ``__repr__`` methods to validators (:issue:`204`). Thanks :user:`philtay`.

Includes bug fixes from 1.2.6.

2.0.0b1 (2015-04-26)
++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- Errored fields will not appear in (de)serialized output dictionaries (:issue:`153`, :issue:`202`).
- Instantiate ``OPTIONS_CLASS`` in ``SchemaMeta``. This makes ``Schema.opts`` available in metaclass methods. It also causes validation to occur earlier (upon ``Schema`` class declaration rather than instantiation).
- Add ``SchemaMeta.get_declared_fields`` class method to support adding additional declared fields.

Deprecation/Removals:

- Remove ``allow_null`` parameter of ``fields.Nested`` (:issue:`203`).

Changes from 2.0.0a1:

- Fix serialization of `None` for ``fields.Email``.

2.0.0a1 (2015-04-25)
++++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- *Backwards-incompatible*: When ``many=True``, the errors dictionary returned by ``dump`` and ``load`` will be keyed on the indices of invalid items in the (de)serialized collection (:issue:`75`). Add ``index_errors=False`` on a Schema's ``class Meta`` options to disable this behavior.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: By default, fields will raise a ValidationError if the input is ``None``. The ``allow_none`` parameter can override this behavior.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: A ``Field's`` ``default`` parameter is only used if explicitly set and the field's value is missing in the input to `Schema.dump`. If not set, the key will not be present in the serialized output for missing values . This is the behavior for *all* fields. ``fields.Str`` no longer defaults to ``''``, ``fields.Int`` no longer defaults to ``0``, etc. (:issue:`199`). Thanks :user:`jmcarp` for the feedback.
- In ``strict`` mode, a ``ValidationError`` is raised. Error messages are accessed via the ``ValidationError's`` ``messages`` attribute (:issue:`128`).
- Add ``allow_none`` parameter to ``fields.Field``. If ``False`` (the default), validation fails when the field's value is ``None`` (:issue:`76`, :issue:`111`). If ``allow_none`` is ``True``, ``None`` is considered valid and will deserialize to ``None``.
- Schema-level validators can store error messages for multiple fields (:issue:`118`). Thanks :user:`ksesong` for the suggestion.
- Add ``pre_load``, ``post_load``, ``pre_dump``, and ``post_dump`` Schema method decorators for defining pre- and post- processing routines (:issue:`153`, :issue:`179`). Thanks :user:`davidism`, :user:`taion`, and :user:`jmcarp` for the suggestions and feedback. Thanks :user:`taion` for the implementation.
- Error message for ``required`` validation is configurable. (:issue:`78`). Thanks :user:`svenstaro` for the suggestion. Thanks :user:`0xDCA` for the implementation.
- Add ``load_from`` parameter to fields (:issue:`125`). Thanks :user:`hakjoon`.
- Add ``load_only`` and ``dump_only`` parameters to fields (:issue:`61`, :issue:`87`). Thanks :user:`philtay`.
- Add `missing` parameter to fields (:issue:`115`). Thanks :user:`philtay`.
- Schema validators can take an optional ``raw_data`` argument which contains raw input data, incl. data not specified in the schema (:issue:`127`). Thanks :user:`ryanlowe0`.
- Add ``validate.OneOf`` (:issue:`135`) and ``validate.ContainsOnly`` (:issue:`149`) validators. Thanks :user:`philtay`.
- Error messages for validators can be interpolated with `{input}` and other values (depending on the validator).
- ``fields.TimeDelta`` always serializes to an integer value in order to avoid rounding errors (:issue:`105`). Thanks :user:`philtay`.
- Add ``include`` class Meta option to support field names which are Python keywords (:issue:`139`). Thanks :user:`nickretallack` for the suggestion.
- ``exclude`` parameter is respected when used together with ``only`` parameter (:issue:`165`). Thanks :user:`lustdante` for the catch and patch.
- ``fields.List`` works as expected with generators and sets (:issue:`185`). Thanks :user:`sergey-aganezov-jr`.

Deprecation/Removals:

- ``MarshallingError`` and ``UnmarshallingError`` error are deprecated in favor of a single ``ValidationError`` (:issue:`160`).
- ``context`` argument passed to Method fields is deprecated. Use ``self.context`` instead (:issue:`184`).
- Remove ``ForcedError``.
- Remove support for generator functions that yield validators (:issue:`74`). Plain generators of validators are still supported.
- The ``Select/Enum`` field is deprecated in favor of using `validate.OneOf` validator (:issue:`135`).
- Remove legacy, pre-1.0 API (``Schema.data`` and ``Schema.errors`` properties) (:issue:`73`).
- Remove ``null`` value.

- ``Marshaller``, ``Unmarshaller`` were moved to ``marshmallow.marshalling``. These should be considered private API (:issue:`129`).
- Make ``allow_null=True`` the default for ``Nested`` fields. This will make ``None`` serialize to ``None`` rather than a dictionary with empty values (:issue:`132`). Thanks :user:`nickrellack` for the suggestion.

1.2.6 (2015-05-03)
++++++++++++++++++

Bug fixes:

- Fix validation error message for ``fields.Decimal``.

1.2.1 (2015-01-11)
++++++++++++++++++

Bug fixes:

- A ``Schema's`` ``error_handler``--if defined--will execute if ``Schema.validate`` returns validation errors (:issue:`121`).
- Deserializing `None` returns `None` rather than raising an ``AttributeError`` (:issue:`123`). Thanks :user:`RealSalmon` for the catch and patch.

1.2.0 (2014-12-22)
++++++++++++++++++

Features:

- Add ``QuerySelect`` and ``QuerySelectList`` fields (:issue:`84`).
- Convert validators in ``marshmallow.validate`` into class-based callables to make them easier to use when declaring fields (:issue:`85`).
- Add ``Decimal`` field which is safe to use when dealing with precise numbers (:issue:`86`).

Thanks :user:`philtay` for these contributions.

- ``Date`` fields correctly deserializes to a ``datetime.date`` object when ``python-dateutil`` is not installed (:issue:`79`). Thanks :user:`malexer` for the catch and patch.
- Fix bug that raised an ``AttributeError`` when using a class-based validator.
- Fix ``as_string`` behavior of Number fields when serializing to default value.
- Deserializing ``None`` or the empty string with either a ``DateTime``, ``Date``, ``Time`` or ``TimeDelta`` results in the correct unmarshalling errors (:issue:`96`). Thanks :user:`svenstaro` for reporting and helping with this.
- Fix error handling when deserializing invalid UUIDs (:issue:`106`). Thanks :user:`vesauimonen` for the catch and patch.
- ``Schema.loads`` correctly defaults to use the value of ``self.many`` rather than defaulting to ``False`` (:issue:`108`). Thanks :user:`davidism` for the catch and patch.
- Validators, data handlers, and preprocessors are no longer shared between schema subclasses (:issue:`88`). Thanks :user:`amikholap` for reporting.
- Fix error handling when passing a ``dict`` or ``list`` to a ``ValidationError`` (:issue:`110`). Thanks :user:`ksesong` for reporting.

Features:

- Add ``Schema.validate`` method which validates input data against a schema. Similar to ``Schema.load``, but does not call ``make_object`` and only returns the errors dictionary.
- Add several validation functions to the ``validate`` module. Thanks :user:`philtay`.
- Store field name and instance on exceptions raised in ``strict`` mode.

Bug fixes:

- Fix serializing dictionaries when field names are methods of ``dict`` (e.g. ``"items"``). Thanks :user:`rozenm` for reporting.
- If a Nested field is passed ``many=True``, ``None`` serializes to an empty list. Thanks :user:`nickretallack` for reporting.
- Fix behavior of ``many`` argument passed to ``dump`` and ``load``. Thanks :user:`svenstaro` for reporting and helping with this.
- Fix ``skip_missing`` behavior for ``String`` and ``List`` fields. Thanks :user:`malexer` for reporting.

1.0.1 (2014-11-18)
++++++++++++++++++

Hotfix release.

- Ensure that errors dictionary is correctly cleared on each call to Schema.dump and Schema.load.

1.0.0 (2014-11-16)
++++++++++++++++++

Adds new features, speed improvements, better error handling, and updated documentation.

- Add ``skip_missing`` ``class Meta`` option.
- A field's ``default`` may be a callable.
- Allow accessor function to be configured via the ``Schema.accessor`` decorator or the ``__accessor__`` class member.
- ``URL`` and ``Email`` fields are validated upon serialization.

- Move a number of utility functions from fields.py to utils.py.
- More useful ``repr`` for ``Field`` classes.
- If a field's default is ``fields.missing`` and its serialized value is ``None``, it will not be included in the final serialized result.
- Schema.dumps no longer coerces its result to a binary string on Python 3.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: Schema output is no longer an ``OrderedDict`` by default. If you want ordered field output, you must explicitly set the ``ordered`` option to ``True``.
- *Backwards-incompatible*: `error` parameter of the `Field` constructor is deprecated. Raise a `ValidationError` instead.
- Expanded test coverage.
- Updated docs.

1.0.0-a (2014-10-19)
++++++++++++++++++++

Major reworking and simplification of the public API, centered around support for deserialization, improved validation, and a less stateful ``Schema`` class.

* Rename ``Serializer`` to ``Schema``.
* Support for deserialization.
* Use the ``Schema.dump`` and ``Schema.load`` methods for serializing and deserializing, respectively.
* *Backwards-incompatible*: Remove ``Serializer.json`` and ``Serializer.to_json``. Use ``Schema.dumps`` instead.
* Reworked fields interface.
* *Backwards-incompatible*: ``Field`` classes implement ``_serialize`` and ``_deserialize`` methods. ``serialize`` and ``deserialize`` comprise the public API for a ``Field``. ``Field.format`` and ``Field.output`` have been removed.
* Add ``exceptions.ForcedError`` which allows errors to be raised during serialization (instead of storing errors in the ``errors`` dict).
* *Backwards-incompatible*: ``DateTime`` field serializes to ISO8601 format by default (instead of RFC822).
* *Backwards-incompatible*: Remove ``Serializer.factory`` method. It is no longer necessary with the ``dump`` method.
* *Backwards-incompatible*: Allow nesting a serializer within itself recursively. Use ``exclude`` or ``only`` to prevent infinite recursion.
* *Backwards-incompatible*: Multiple errors can be stored for a single field. The errors dictionary returned by ``load`` and ``dump`` have lists of error messages keyed by field name.
* Remove ``validated`` decorator. Validation occurs within ``Field`` methods.
* ``Function`` field raises a ``ValueError`` if an uncallable object is passed to its constructor.
* ``Nested`` fields inherit context from their parent.
* Add ``Schema.preprocessor`` and ``Schema.validator`` decorators for registering preprocessing and schema-level validation functions respectively.
* Custom error messages can be specified by raising a ``ValidationError`` within a validation function.
* Extra keyword arguments passed to a Field are stored as metadata.
* Fix ordering of field output.
* Fix behavior of the ``required`` parameter on ``Nested`` fields.
* Fix serializing keyed tuple types (e.g. ``namedtuple``) with ``class Meta`` options.
* Fix default value for ``Fixed`` and ``Price`` fields.
* Fix serialization of binary strings.
* ``Schemas`` can inherit fields from non-``Schema`` base classes (e.g. mixins). Also, fields are inherited according to the MRO (rather than recursing over base classes). Thanks :user:`jmcarp`.
* Add ``Str``, ``Bool``, and ``Int`` field class aliases.

0.7.0 (2014-06-22)
++++++++++++++++++

* Add ``Serializer.error_handler`` decorator that registers a custom error handler.
* Add ``Serializer.data_handler`` decorator that registers data post-processing callbacks.
* *Backwards-incompatible*: ``process_data`` method is deprecated. Use the ``data_handler`` decorator instead.
* Fix bug that raised error when passing ``extra`` data together with ``many=True``. Thanks :user:`buttsicles` for reporting.
* If ``required=True`` validation is violated for a given ``Field``, it will raise an error message that is different from the message specified by the ``error`` argument. Thanks :user:`asteinlein`.
* More generic error message raised when required field is missing.
* ``validated`` decorator should only wrap a ``Field`` class's ``output`` method.

0.6.0 (2014-06-03)
++++++++++++++++++

* Fix bug in serializing keyed tuple types, e.g. ``namedtuple`` and ``KeyedTuple``.
* Nested field can load a serializer by its class name as a string. This makes it easier to implement 2-way nesting.
* Make Serializer.data override-able.

0.5.5 (2014-05-02)
++++++++++++++++++

* Add ``Serializer.factory`` for creating a factory function that returns a Serializer instance.
* ``MarshallingError`` stores its underlying exception as an instance variable. This is useful for inspecting errors.
* ``fields.Select`` is aliased to ``fields.Enum``.
* Add ``fields.__all__`` and ``marshmallow.__all__`` so that the modules can be more easily extended.
* Expose ``Serializer.OPTIONS_CLASS`` as a class variable so that options defaults can be overridden.
* Add ``Serializer.process_data`` hook that allows subclasses to manipulate the final output data.

0.5.4 (2014-04-17)
++++++++++++++++++

* Add ``json_module`` class Meta option.
* Add ``required`` option to fields . Thanks :user:`DeaconDesperado`.
* Tested on Python 3.4 and PyPy.

0.5.3 (2014-03-02)
++++++++++++++++++

* Fix ``Integer`` field default. It is now ``0`` instead of ``0.0``. Thanks :user:`kalasjocke`.
* Add ``context`` param to ``Serializer``. Allows accessing arbitrary objects in ``Function`` and ``Method`` fields.
* ``Function`` and ``Method`` fields raise ``MarshallingError`` if their argument is uncallable.


0.5.2 (2014-02-10)
++++++++++++++++++

* Enable custom field validation via the ``validate`` parameter.
* Add ``utils.from_rfc`` for parsing RFC datestring to Python datetime object.

++++++++++++++++++

* Can customize validation error messages by passing the ``error`` parameter to a field.
* *Backwards-incompatible*: Rename ``fields.NumberField`` -> ``fields.Number``.
* Add ``fields.Select``. Thanks :user:`ecarreras`.
* Support nesting a Serializer within itself by passing ``"self"`` into ``fields.Nested`` (only up to depth=1).
* *Backwards-incompatible*: No implicit serializing of collections. Must set ``many=True`` if serializing to a list. This ensures that marshmallow handles singular objects correctly, even if they are iterable.
* If Nested field ``only`` parameter is a field name, only return a single value for the nested object (instead of a dict) or a flat list of values.
* Improved performance and stability.

0.4.1 (2013-12-01)
++++++++++++++++++

* An object's ``__marshallable__`` method, if defined, takes precedence over ``__getitem__``.
* Generator expressions can be passed to a serializer.
* Better support for serializing list-like collections (e.g. ORM querysets).
* Other minor bugfixes.

++++++++++++++++++

* Add ``additional`` `class Meta` option.
* Add ``dateformat`` `class Meta` option.

* String field defaults to empty string instead of ``None``.
* *Backwards-incompatible*: ``isoformat`` and ``rfcformat`` functions moved to utils.py.
* *Backwards-incompatible*: Validation functions moved to validate.py.
* *Backwards-incompatible*: Remove types.py.

* Ensure that ``to_json`` returns bytestrings.
* Fix bug with including an object property in ``fields`` Meta option.
* Fix bug with passing ``None`` to a serializer.

0.3.1 (2013-11-16)
++++++++++++++++++

* Fix bug with serializing dictionaries.
* Fix error raised when serializing empty list.
* Add ``only`` and ``exclude`` parameters to Serializer constructor.

* Updated Flask + SQLA example in docs.

0.3.0 (2013-11-14)
++++++++++++++++++

* Declaring Serializers just got easier. The *class Meta* paradigm allows you to specify fields more concisely. Can specify ``fields`` and ``exclude`` options.
* Allow date formats to be changed by passing ``format`` parameter to ``DateTime`` field constructor. Can either be ``"rfc"`` (default), ``"iso"``, or a date format string.
* More useful error message when declaring fields as classes (instead of an instance, which is the correct usage).
* Rename MarshallingException -> MarshallingError.
