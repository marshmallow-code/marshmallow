Contributing Guidelines
=======================

So you're interested in contributing to marshmallow or `one of our associated
projects <https://github.com/marshmallow-code>`__? That's awesome! We
welcome contributions from anyone willing to work in good faith with
other contributors and the community (see also our
:ref:`code-of-conduct`).

Questions, Feature Requests, Bug Reports, and Feedback…
-------------------------------------------------------

…should all be reported on the `Github Issue Tracker`_ .

.. _`Github Issue Tracker`: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues?state=open

Ways to Contribute
------------------

- Comment on some of marshmallow's `open issues <https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues>`_ (especially those `labeled "feedback welcome" <https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22feedback+welcome%22>`_). Share a solution or workaround. Make a suggestion for how a feature can be made better. Opinions are welcome!
- Improve `the docs <https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io>`_. For straightforward edits, click the ReadTheDocs menu button in the bottom-right corner of the page and click "Edit".  See the :ref:`Documentation <contributing_documentation>` section of this page if you want to build the docs locally.
- If you think you've found a bug, `open an issue <https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues>`_.
- Contribute an :ref:`example usage <contributing_examples>` of marshmallow.
- Send a PR for an open issue (especially one `labeled "please help" <https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22please+help%22>`_). The next section details how to contribute code.


Contributing Code
-----------------

In General
++++++++++

- `PEP 8`_, when sensible.
- Test ruthlessly. Write docs for new features.
- Even more important than Test-Driven Development--*Human-Driven Development*.

.. _`PEP 8`: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

In Particular
+++++++++++++


Setting Up for Local Development
********************************

1. Fork marshmallow_ on Github. ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow.git
    $ cd marshmallow

2. Install development requirements. It is highly recommended that you use a virtualenv. ::

    # After activating your virtualenv
    $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

3. Install marshmallow in develop mode. ::

   $ pip install -e .

Git Branch Structure
********************

Marshmallow abides by the following branching model:


``dev``
    Current development branch. **New features should branch off here**.

``pypi``
    Current production release on PyPI.

``X.Y-line``
    Maintenance branch for release ``X.Y``. **Bug fixes should be sent to the most recent release branch.** The maintainer will forward-port the fix to ``dev``. Note: exceptions may be made for bug fixes that introduce large code changes.

**Always make a new branch for your work**, no matter how small. Also, **do not put unrelated changes in the same branch or pull request**. This makes it more difficult to merge your changes.

Pull Requests
**************

1. Create a new local branch.
::

    # For a new feature
    $ git checkout -b name-of-feature dev

    # For a bugfix
    $ git checkout -b fix-something 2.x-line

2. Commit your changes. Write `good commit messages <http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>`_.
::

    $ git commit -m "Detailed commit message"
    $ git push origin name-of-feature

3. Before submitting a pull request, check the following:

- If the pull request adds functionality, it is tested and the docs are updated.
- You've added yourself to ``AUTHORS.rst``.

4. Submit a pull request to ``marshmallow-code:dev`` or the appropriate maintenance branch. The `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/marshmallow-code/marshmallow>`_ build must be passing before your pull request is merged.

Running tests
*************

To run all tests: ::

    $ invoke test

To run tests on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and PyPy virtual environments (must have each interpreter installed): ::

    $ tox

.. _contributing_documentation:

Documentation
*************

Contributions to the documentation are welcome. Documentation is written in `reStructured Text`_ (rST). A quick rST reference can be found `here <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_. Builds are powered by Sphinx_.

To install the packages for building the docs, run the following in the root of the project: ::

    $ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

To build the docs: ::

    $ invoke docs -b

The ``-b`` (for "browse") automatically opens up the docs in your browser after building.

You can also build the docs in "watch" mode: ::

   $ pip install sphinx-autobuild
   $ invoke docs -wb

Changes in the `docs/` directory will automatically trigger a rebuild.


.. _contributing_examples:

Contributing Examples
*********************

Have a usage example you'd like to share? A custom `Field` that others might find useful? Feel free to add it to the `examples <https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/tree/dev/examples>`_ directory and send a pull request.
