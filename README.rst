**marshmallow** is an ORM/ODM/framework-agnostic library for converting complex datatypes, such as objects, to and from native Python datatypes.

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import date
    from marshmallow import Schema, fields, pprint


    class ArtistSchema(Schema):
        name = fields.Str()


    class AlbumSchema(Schema):
        title = fields.Str()
        release_date = fields.Date()
        artist = fields.Nested(ArtistSchema())


    bowie = dict(name="David Bowie")
    album = dict(artist=bowie, title="Hunky Dory", release_date=date(1971, 12, 17))

    schema = AlbumSchema()
    result = schema.dump(album)
    pprint(result, indent=2)
    # { 'artist': {'name': 'David Bowie'},
    #   'release_date': '1971-12-17',
    #   'title': 'Hunky Dory'}


In short, marshmallow schemas can be used to:

- **Validate** input data.
- **Deserialize** input data to app-level objects.
- **Serialize** app-level objects to primitive Python types. The serialized objects can then be rendered to standard formats such as JSON for use in an HTTP API.
